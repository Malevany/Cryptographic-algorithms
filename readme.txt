Cryptographic Application in C#
This application implements classic cryptographic algorithms in C#, including the Caesar cipher and a modified version of the Vigenère cipher known as the Belazo cipher.

Algorithms Description
Caesar Cipher
The Caesar cipher is a method of encryption that substitutes each letter of the text with a letter found a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. In our implementation, we use a specified shift value.

Belazo Cipher (Modified Vigenère Cipher)
The Belazo cipher is a modified version of the Vigenère cipher where the encryption key changes during the encryption process. This cipher enhances security by altering the encryption key dynamically.
